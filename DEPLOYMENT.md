   - `script.js`
   - `README.md`
3. Write a commit message like "Initial commit - Meal Planner App"
4. Click "Commit changes"

# Navigate to your MealsApp folder
cd "c:\Users\tihowell\MealsApp"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit - Meal Planner App"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPONAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

## Step 4: Access Your Live Site

1. After a few minutes, your site will be available at:
   `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/YOURREPONAME/`

2. GitHub will show you the exact URL in the Pages settings

## Step 5: Update the Links (Optional)

1. Edit your `README.md` file on GitHub
2. Replace `[Your GitHub Pages URL will go here]` with your actual URL
3. Replace the footer link in `index.html` if desired

## üéâ You're Done!

Your meal planner is now live and accessible to you and your partner from anywhere!

## üì± Sharing with Your Partner

Simply share the GitHub Pages URL with your partner. They can:
